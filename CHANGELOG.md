## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Configurable gate authorization on all mutation operations (`gate` config key)
- `AuthorizesPermissionsAccess` trait for shared authorization logic
- `ManagesEntity` trait extracting shared modal create/edit/save/close logic
- Unique validation scoped to guard for role and permission names
- `#[Computed]` attribute on `filteredPermissions` for request-lifecycle caching
- `user_search_fields` config now wired into UsersTable with custom search callback
- `group_permissions` config toggle for PermissionsTable group column and RolePermissionsModal grouping
- Tab input validation in PermissionsManager (rejects invalid tab values)
- Try/catch around sync operations with error toast notifications
- Translation key `user_fallback` for missing user display name
- Full test suite: 120 tests, 219 assertions (Pest + Livewire + Orchestra Testbench)
- AI integration scaffold: MCP tools, skills, component docs, integrity tests
- Laravel Boost MCP tool registration (conditional on Boost presence)

### Fixed
- Hardcoded Spanish fallback `'Usuario #'` replaced with translatable string
- Falsy guard checks (`!$this->roleId`) replaced with strict `=== null`
- Spatie permission cache now cleared on all delete operations (single and bulk)
- N+1 queries: replaced eager loading with `withCount()` on all three tables
- Config key names in README/DOCS (`route_prefix` → `prefix`, `route_middleware` → `middleware`)
- PHP version requirement in docs corrected to 8.2+
- `$user` property reset to null in `UserAssignmentsModal::close()` to prevent stale serialization

### Changed
- `RoleModal` and `PermissionModal` refactored to use `ManagesEntity` trait
- `RolesTable` and `PermissionsTable` override `query()` with aggregate counts
- `UsersTable` uses `withCount('permissions')` instead of `getDirectPermissions()->count()`
